# Algorithmic Trading Strategy

This repository contains a technical analysis-based trading strategy that utilizes a dynamic trailing stop loss to generate long and short signals.

## Overview

The strategy tracks price volatility to set adaptive stop losses. When the price crosses above the trailing stop, a long signal is generated. When the price crosses below the stop, a short signal triggers.

By dynamically sizing stops to volatility, the strategy aims to ride trends while limiting downside.

## Code

The core trading logic is contained in `strategy.pine`. This Pine Script code implements the adaptive stop and signal generation rules.

`backtest.py` provides utilities for loading historical data and analyzing strategy performance.

## Usage

The strategy is designed to run on TradingView using their online charting platform. To use:

1. Open a chart for the desired symbol and timeframe.
2. Add the `strategy.pine` script as an indicator.
3. Set input parameters as desired.
4. View long/short signals directly on the chart.

See TradingView documentation for full instructions on adding/using custom indicators.

## Optimizations

The `a` and `c` input variables control the stop loss rules. Adjust to balance risk, reward, and frequency of signals.

Further enhancements like exit rules, position sizing, and combining with other indicators can build on the base adaptive stop strategy.

Pull requests and improvements are welcome!
